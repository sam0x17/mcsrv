# MCSRV: Minecraft Bindings for Ruby
MCSRV is the core library used by Minecraft Host Ninja to interact with local and remote Minecraft servers.
MCSV uses the popular Net::SSH library to directly interact with the Minecraft command line via SSH. Anything 
that can be done via the Minecraft server console can be done via MCSRV.

To run from IRB:
```irb -Ilib -rmcsrv```
